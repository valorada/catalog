https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169204619303299","This index is a weighted sum of most relevant biodiversity indicators such as share of green, canopy and herbaceous area as well as connectivity and distance between canopy areas - Use I1090, I1091, I1092 and I1093"
I1090,Sensitivity,Share of green area,"The indicator green cover indicates the proportion of public green spaces covering the entire city or a district (with a recommended target of 30%–40%). This 30%–40% of green coverin the form of public and private green spaces would contribute to a significant air temperature reduction in cities. This indicator is calculated using the total area of all green spaces available under the atmospheric canopy in proportion to the total area of land (Patel et al 2025, https://doi.org/10.1002/cli2.70009).

I1091,Sensitivity,Share of canopy area,"The urban canopy layer height has a significant effect on UHI. The study done by Zauli Sajani et al. (2008) mentioned that the canopy layer height temperature measurements generally underestimate the values of UHI compared to the 10- and 2- m temperature measurement stations. However, canopy layer height measurements fo rurban climate studies are not common, though they provide significant information for understanding the UHI effects (MaShaoXiuetal.2017) (Patel et al 2025, https://doi.org/10.1002/cli2.70009).
