Trees, on the other hand, have more than just positive effects for urban residents. For instance, densely planted trees cool less at night than open meadow areas (Spronken-SmithandOke1999). In addition, tree avenues with canopy closures on busy streets can increase the concentration of air pollutants due to reduced mixing (Venter et al. 2024) (source: Patel et al 2025, https://doi.org/10.1002/cli2.70009).

To derive LST, remote sensing data are predominantly used. However, using LST as an indicator has some limitations, in particular that it cannot directly contribute to calculating human thermal comfort levels. Moreover,LST requires land surface emissivity (LSE) in the calculation methodologies (Patel et al 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cli2.70009).
