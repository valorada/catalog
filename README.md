Validated Local Risk Actionable Data for Adaptation.

## Documentation

A comprehensive documentation on the methodological framework of VALORADA can be found [here](docs/readme.docx). The documentation is designed to help local and regional authorities identify, assess, and enhance the “climate value” of the data they collect, in order to better understand and address local climate risks. It introduces practical tools—including Climate Impact Chains, the Adaptation Catalogue, Data Valuation Metrics, and visualization examples—to integrate local data management with climate adaptation planning and decision-making.

## Data

The main catalog data is stored in the table in the `data` subdirectory. There is mainly two tables containing indicators and datasets. Another tables links both together.

The data in this repository should be [tidy](https://data.europa.eu/apps/data-visualisation-guide/intro-to-tidy-data).

## Catalog views

The content of the catalog data is rendered in different views:

* A user friendly excel table is created by linking all data together. You can download it directly from the repository [here](https://github.com/valorada/catalog/raw/refs/heads/main/catalog.xlsx).
* A static dashboard is deployed [here](https://valorada.github.io/dashboard).
