D0051,Live Leaf Fuel Load,Fuel characteristics,"Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have expanded the potential use across scientific applications, including weather and hazard forecasting. The ability of these methods to extract information from diverse and novel data types enables the transition from forecasting fire weather, to predicting actual fire activity. In this study we demonstrate that this shift is feasible also within an operational context. Traditional methods of fire forecasts tend to over predict high fire danger, particularly in fuel limited biomes, often resulting in false alarms. By using data on fuel characteristics, ignitions and observed fire activity, data-driven predictions reduce the false-alarm rate of high-danger forecasts, enhancing their accuracy. This is made possible by high quality global datasets of fuel evolution and fire detection. ",,Fuel model
