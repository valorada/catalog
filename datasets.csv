The ability of these methods to extract information from diverse and novel data types enables the transition from forecasting fire weather, to predicting actual fire activity. In this study we demonstrate that this shift is feasible also within an operational context. Traditional methods of fire forecasts tend to over predict high fire danger, particularly in fuel limited biomes, often resulting in false alarms. By using data on fuel characteristics, ignitions and observed fire activity, data-driven predictions reduce the false-alarm rate of high-danger forecasts, enhancing their accuracy. This is made possible by high quality global datasets of fuel evolution and fire detection.

In order to structure, coordinate and focus future developments and benefit from international collaboration in new areas, a flexible system named ECLand, which would facilitate modular extensions to support numerical weather prediction (NWP) and society-relevant operational services, for example, Copernicus, is presented. This paper introduces recent examples of novel ECLand developments on (i) vegetation; (ii) snow; (iii) soil; (iv) open water/lake; (v) river/inundation; and (vi) urban areas.

D0063,Lightning,ignition,"In this paper it is shown that for an ensemble prediction system the CRPS can be decomposed into a reliability part and a resolution/uncertainty part, in a way that is similar to the decomposition of the Brier score. The reliability part of the CRPS is closely connected to the rank histogram of the ensemble, while the resolution/uncertainty part can be related to the average spread within the ensemble and the behavior of its outliers. The usefulness of such a decomposition is illustrated for the ensemble prediction system running at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.

Georeferenced information on road infrastructure is essential for spatial planning, socio-economic assessments and environmental impact analyses. Yet current global road maps are typically outdated or characterized by spatial bias in coverage. In the Global Roads Inventory Project we gathered, harmonized and integrated nearly 60 geospatial datasets on road infrastructure into a global roads dataset. The resulting dataset covers 222 countries and includes over 21 million km of roads, which is two to three times the total length in the currently best available country-based global roads datasets.
